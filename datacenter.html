It refers to computing being done in a remote  location, rather than on the desktop or portable device. The goal of cloud  computing is to provide easy, scalable access to computing resources and IT  services. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cloud computing services are broadly divided into three categories:  </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="libulletblue">Infrastructure-as-a-Service (<u>IaaS</u>)</li>
            <li class="libulletblue"> Platform-as-a-Service (<u>PaaS)</u></li>
            <li class="libulletblue">              Software-as-a-Service (<u>SaaS</u>)</li>
          </ul>

          <p><img src="images/idcbackup.jpg" width="95" height="83" style="float:left; padding:0 20px 10px 0;" />No individual or company is resistant to  data failure. Loss of critical data can be devastating.
